## Healthy-Honey-Apiary
First year hardware project by IT faculty University of Moratuwa

Our project was to design a beehive that gets maximum harvest.
In most beehives users cannot obtain the maximum harvest because of various reasons that happens to bees such as,
1. Temperature, humidity changes.
2. Predator threats.
3. Threats from 'iti salabaya' at night time.
4. Disturbance by the user.
etc....
As a team we search about this every aspects came up with solutions for almost all the circumstances. 
And we successfully done our project within a year.
For all the works we used atmega32 microcontroller and we designed a mobile app that can check every condition of the beehive. 
Our team members worked hard day by day to achive this target.❤️
